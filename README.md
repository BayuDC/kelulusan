# Silulus

So the company where I work(a school) asked me to create a website that functions to announce the graduation of its students.
This project is just a single page application that show a countdown then it is show a login form if the countdown is finished.
Students can log in using their student id(called NIS) and a password to see their graduation status.
BTW the name of this project is so fucking cringe right?
